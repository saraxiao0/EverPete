You can use this folder with any Twine (1 & 2) format, as long as you save the format in the right place (see *Adding other Formats* in the Guide).

/!\ WARNING /!\
A New IFID should be generated before using the template. See the *The Mandatory Passages* page in the Guide.

========Notes:
This guide includes instructions on installing and using Tweego for both MacOS and Windows devices, as well as Twine 1 and 2 formats. It also explains how to read and use the Twee Notation, and include scripts to make the use of Tweego smoother.

I highly recommend checking the chosen format's documentation if you need help coding in that format.

If you have any question about or any issue with the template, send me an ask over on Tumblr or comment on the asset page.
